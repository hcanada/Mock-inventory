# Project Context

This project is an INTERMEDIATE MERN stack Inventory Management System.
It is built for portfolio and interview demonstration, not a real business.

## Goals

- Showcase clean backend architecture
- Demonstrate REST API design
- Use MongoDB properly (schemas, indexes, aggregation)
- Implement JWT auth and RBAC
- Keep code readable and reviewable

## Engineering Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Explicit code over magic
- Minimal abstractions
- No premature optimization
- Fail loudly, handle errors gracefully

## Stack

Backend:

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT, bcrypt

Frontend:

- React (hooks)
- Axios
- Chart library (later)

## Rules for Claude

- Do NOT invent features outside the PRD
- Do NOT change data models without asking
- Do NOT mix frontend and backend work
- Prefer small, incremental changes
- Always explain architectural decisions briefly

## Code Style

- ES6 modules
- Async/await only
- No anonymous magic middleware
- Meaningful variable and function names

## Project Status

Current phase: Backend foundation
